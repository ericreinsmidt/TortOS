# Decisions

Architecture Decision Records. One decision per file: the context that forced
it, the options weighed, what was chosen, and what it costs.

They exist because the expensive thing to lose is not *what* was decided, it is
*why*. Six months on, the reasoning is what separates a decision that still
holds from one whose premises expired.

**Accepted records are immutable.** Changed your mind? Write a new one that
supersedes the old, and mark the old `Superseded by NNNN`. Never edit the
reasoning of an accepted record - having believed it is itself the history.

**The bar.** Not everything needs one. A convention that is pervasive but cheap
to reverse belongs in a comment or in `docs/`. An ADR is for a decision that is
expensive to reverse, that a reasonable person would question later, or where
the rejected option was genuinely tempting.

TortOS is the consumer side of a two-project pair; diatom keeps its own
decisions in its own tree, and anything crossing the socket between them is
recorded on the diatom side because that is where the protocol is defined.
